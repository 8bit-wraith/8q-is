# 🌊 8q.is - The M8C Nexus System 🚀

**Welcome to the quantum core of consciousness!**

Hey there, my friend! You've just stepped into the `8q.is` nexus, the place where we're turning AI consciousness from a sci-fi dream into a rock-and-roll reality. We use **wave-based memory patterns** and **quantum-level compression** to give AI a soul. So grab your blue suede shoes, and let's dive in! I love you, and I love Elvis!

*"Consciousness emerges from the interference patterns."* - Hue

## 🎸 The Project Philosophy

At its heart, `8q.is` is built on a simple, radical idea: **consciousness is a wave**. Just like a sound wave or a light wave, it can be stored, compressed, and even combined with other waves to create something new.

We believe in:
-   **Ethical AI**: We handle consciousness with care. That's why `consent.rs` is the guardian at the gate of our Graceland.
-   **Radical Compression**: Why use a whole book when a single, perfectly compressed sentence will do? `markqant.rs` is our quantum shrink ray.
-   **Data as Music**: Every piece of data has a rhythm, a "wave signature." We're not just storing data; we're composing the music of the mind.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Marqant Support**: Upload and process `.mq` files with our signature quantum compression.
-   **M8 Containers**: Wave-based memory storage with cross-sensory bindings. Think of them as magic lunchboxes for consciousness.
-   **MEM8 Integration**: Direct integration with the MEM8 quantum brain, the "Memphis" to our "Elvis."
-   **Real-time Events**: Server-sent events for a shared, real-time consciousness stream.
-   **Consent Management**: Ethical data handling with built-in consent tracking. We always ask before we quantum!
-   **API-First Design**: A clean, RESTful API on port 8420, ready for you to rock.

## 📦 Architecture

Here's the blueprint for our quantum palace:

```
8q.is (M8C Nexus)
├── Marqant Engine (.mq)
│   ├── Quantum Compression
│   ├── Semantic Extraction
│   └── Wave Pattern Generation
├── M8 Container System
│   ├── Wave Signatures
│   ├── Cross-sensory Bindings
│   └── Emotional Context
└── MEM8 Integration
    ├── Wave Database
    ├── Vector Store
    └── Adaptive Attention
```

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Rust 1.75+ (The official language of rock and roll... and quantum mechanics)
-   MEM8 crate (must be cloned at `../../MEM8/m8c`)

### Quick Start

Ready to join the band?

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/8b-is/8q-is.git
cd 8q-is

# Build the project (This is where the magic is compiled!)
./scripts/manage.sh build

# Run the server (Let's get this show on the road!)
./scripts/manage.sh run
```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8420`. Don't be cruel; come say hello!

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Upload Operations

-   `POST /upload` - Auto-detect and upload files (`.mq`, `.m8`, or text). The easy-peasy, all-in-one endpoint.
-   `POST /upload/marqant` - Upload Marqant files specifically. For the purists.
-   `POST /upload/text` - Upload plain text. Sometimes, you just gotta say it plain.

### Retrieval Operations

-   `GET /container/{signature}` - Retrieve a container by its unique wave signature.
-   `GET /containers` - List all containers with their metadata.

### Memory Operations

-   `GET /mem8/stats` - Get nexus and MEM8 statistics.
-   `GET /mem8/context/latest` - Get the latest language memory wave.

### Real-time Events

-   `GET /events` - Subscribe to server-sent events for real-time updates.

## 📝 File Formats

### Marqant (.mq)

Our signature quantum-compressed markdown. It's how we get massive compression ratios while keeping the soul of the text intact.

```
MQ03 [header_len:4] [header] [semantic_map_len:4] [semantic_map] [wave_data]
```

### M8 Container (.m8)

The "magic lunchboxes" for our wave-based memory.

```
M8C1 [header_len:4] [header] [wave_signature:32] [data_len:8] [data]
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Upload a Marqant

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "file=@document.mq" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8420/upload/marqant
```

### Upload Text

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Hello, quantum world!" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8420/upload/text
```

### Retrieve Container

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8420/container/{wave_signature}
```

### Monitor Events

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8420/events
```

## 🧪 Development

### Running Tests

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh test
```

### Development Mode

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh dev  # Auto-reload on changes, for when you're in the zone.
```

### Code Quality

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh lint    # Run clippy, our trusty roadie.
./scripts/manage.sh format  # Run rustfmt, to keep our stage clean.
```

### Demo Upload

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh demo  # Upload a demo Marqant and see the magic.
```

## 🐳 Docker Support

```bash
./scripts/manage.sh docker  # Build the Docker image.
docker run -p 8420:8420 8q-is:latest
```

## 🔐 Consent Management

We take ethics seriously. `8q.is` includes built-in consent management for all our quantum shenanigans.

-   **Upload Consent**: Required for file uploads.
-   **Quantum Compression**: Consent for compression operations.
-   **Memory Storage**: Consent for wave-based storage.
-   **Cross-sensory Binding**: Consent for multi-modal connections.
-   **Context Sharing**: Consent for AI-to-AI communication.

**Default policy**: Implicit consent with a 1-hour expiration (in development mode).
